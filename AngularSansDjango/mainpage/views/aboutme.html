				I was born and raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where I spent countless hours playing video games, and writing games to play in BASIC, and on my TI-83.  I am a recent graduate of Rocket University, where I learned to program in Javascript and Python, to utilize frameworks and libraries for these languages.  I am constantly studying to learn new languages, and new ways to increase my skills with what I already know.

			<p class="lead">
				I love video games, and I love to problem solve, and I work to incorporate both into my life whenever possible.  The projects I try to develop are sometimes inspired by problems I want to try to solve, and other times the result of my boundless excitement over a game.
